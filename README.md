## ❓ Why HTML and CSS? 
Mainly because the purpose of this exercise was to learn how to use these two languages.

## 👷🏽‍♀️ What did I build? 
An interface identical to the one that Google's main page currently has was replicated. It was divided into 3 main HTML sections:
1. Header
2. Logo and search bar
3. Footer

## 🏆 Purpose 
Learning, practice and introduction to the elements and properties of HTML and CSS
